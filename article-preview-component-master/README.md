I have learnt to use CSS Grids for the card layout. I have used the best CSS practices and the correct HTML Semantics 


<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
} 
```-->
